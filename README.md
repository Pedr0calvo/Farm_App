## Farm App

This app was created with React Native.

This is a farm application for managing greenhouses here 
you can create your user, users can have many farms and on each farm, 
you can save data on monitoring, applications and harvests.

So that you can have the repository on your computer locally you must clone it.
Then in the root folder you have two folders client and api, in both you have to run the
npm install command. Then in the api folder, you must create an .env file with this content: 
DB_USER = "Your DB user" DB_PASSWORD = "Your DB password" DB_HOST = "Your database host" 
DB_NAME = "The name of the database" PORT = "The port database" After running the npm start command,
the app will open in the browser.

Then the npm start command in client you must have an emulator on your computer 
or a expo app on your mobile device.
